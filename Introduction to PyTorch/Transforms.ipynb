    "In PyTorch, we use `Transforms` to process data and make it suitable for training. All `TorchVision` datasets have two parameters:\n",
    "- `transform` defines the feature-scope manipulations\n",
    "- `target_transform` defines the label-scope manipulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the FashionMNIST data for instance, the features are in PIL `Image` format, and the labels are integers corresponding to the classes. To make the data suitable for training, we need the features to be normalized tensors and the labels as one-hot encoders, which can be tackled with PyTorch's `ToTensor` and `Lambda` classes."
